# Background WPM Calculator

A small program that watches what you type to calculate your actual average words per minute typing speed. Should be more accurate than normal typing tests as it allows you to type anything you'd like, rather than trying to read their text and retype it. 

Lots of work to still do, stay tuned!

## Setup Info
This script was written for Windows environments, but as long as your system can run `Python 3`, any OS will probably work just fine. You also need to install the required packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Afterward, you can use Python 3 to run the script, such as via `python main.py`. 

Feel free to open an issue if you have any questions or if something isn't working right!
